# Final Project - Sebastian James | Music 220A | Spring 2021  

 ## Milestone 1:  
 ### Three Proposals for my Final Project:  
 1. Creating an interactive audiovisual experience using the *oscP5* library in **Processing** and using *osc* messaging in **ChucK**.  
    * First, I will take in visuals from a camera in **Processing** (most likely reusing code), then using the *OSC network protocol* to communicate with **ChucK**.
    * The deliverable product would be a type of audiovisual art display with a responsive visual generated by **Processing** paired with responsive audio from **ChucK**.
