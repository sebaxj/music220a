    String Plucking Impulse UGen built on SinOsc drone <br />
    Sebastian James <br />
    <br />

    For part 1, I played around with the FM synthesis examples. I chose to
    manipulate the "Chuck-time" variable, changing the dac output from every
    sample, to every 1000 samples. I noticed that as I increased the time
    between samples being sent to dac, the "wave-like" appearance of the carrier
    signal modulating became more apparent. At this sample rate I noticed the
    most desirable sound, changing what once appeared as a constant tone, to a
    noticeable oscillating output. <br />
    <br />
    For part 2, I first used the SinOsc UGen to generate an A major third drone
    at 440 Hz. I then built a string "pluck" sound using an impulse UGen to play
    over this drone at random frequencies. Furthermore, I then hard coded an
    array of notes in the A-major triad (using their respective MIDI note
    values) to only play consonant sounds. I initially ran into issues writing
    the delay for the string plucks. I either was overloaded with feedback, or
    recieved a short tone. It taught me alot playing around with the Impulse
    UGen and how it can be manipulated vastly with only small increments in its
    associated values. The other issue I noticed was that if I played the plucks
    at lower frequencies, the delay filter was overloaded and the sound would be
    cut and an error message would appear in the console. I fixed this by
    raising the plucks by one octave. <br />
