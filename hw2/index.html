    Part 1 Chord Statement:<br />
    In this statement, I built a chord progression following:<br />
    <br />
    i-ii dim-V-i-i 4/2-III-iii/III-V dim7/III-i<br />
    <br />
    I used an array of oscillators to create polyphony, and manipulated ADSR
    variables to create more texture. Additionally, I created artificial
    artifacts on ii dim and V dim7/III be setting an attack of 0::ms. This
    created a very reverberant cacophony.<br />

    Part 2: <br />
    <br />
    In part 2, I created a C major third interval which plays throughout the
    piece. On top of this, I added random MIDI notes between 50 and 70. All of
    this was played with a random density engine.<br />

    Part 3: Distex, Sebastian James<br />
    <br />

    Essentially, my idea was to create different textures layered on top of each
    other.<br />
    <br />
    1. Dissonance vs consonance<br />
    2. Gain<br />
    3. Density<br />
    4. Tempo<br />
    <br />

    To do that, I start with a b diminished chord which is played with variant
    textures and tempos. Following, I used a SndBuf UGen to import a heartbeat
    sample which I played through the density engine created in Part 2.
    Additionally, I swept the LPF from high to low, so that while density
    continued at random, the LPF decreased linearly from 800 Hz to 50 Hz.
    Following the "heartbeat section", I played the chord progression from part
    1 through the same signal chain as earlier in the statement, finally
    completing a modulation from C, to Am (I to iv).<br />
