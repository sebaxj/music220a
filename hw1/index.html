    Music 220a Homework 1, Spring 2021 <br />
    Hand-Crafted Digital Audio <br />

    Reflection for Part 1: <br />
    I find that when looking at spectrograms of the waveforms, translating
    between sound and sight when it comes to frequency is easy. For example,
    when looking at the noise spectrograms, it is intuitive that all frequencies
    are represented concurrently in the sound, relating in a “fuzzy” sound and a
    “fuzzy” image. Furthermore, when looking at the noise spectrogram with the
    low pass filter, the higher frequencies are gradually filtered out as the
    resonance filter frequency sweeps low to high; again, this is logical to
    translate between sight and sound. Part 1b, which has the noise chucked
    through an ADSR envelope, surprised me. The attack and delay were faster
    than I thought, with the sustain lasting much longer that what can be heard
    in the waveform. Seeing this graphical representation of the ADSR envelope
    helped illustrate to me the scale factor size of each element of the
    envelope. However, parts 1f, 1g, and 1h have more complex spectrograms. That
    is why I chose the spectrogram of the square oscillator as the most
    interesting. The harmonics built upon the fundamental frequency create an
    artistic spectrogram which resembles modern graphical art. When listening to
    the waveform, this is reflected in the wobbly harmonic signals we can hear
    in the background. <br />
    <br />
    Something I should add is that I wrote two versions of the noise with filter
    sweep. In one version, I swept the resonance filter frequency manually,
    WITHOUT sporking, and in the second version, I wrote the code to sweep the
    resonance filter frequency in a separate function which I sporked to run
    concurrently to the noise UGen. I found that the second version which
    sporked the filter frequency gave a smoother transition sweeping from a low
    frequency cutoff, to a high frequency cutoff, and back to the low end.<br />
    <br />
    When reflecting on the spectrograms and listening to their respective
    waveforms, I found that understanding what I saw in the spectrograms helped
    me better understand the code I wrote. Furthermore, once I was better
    acquainted with the spectrograms of certain waveforms, I was able to “hear”
    the code as I was writing it and chucking different oscillators through
    filters, parameters, and effects, which allowed me to be more creative in
    later parts of the homework. <br />

    Part 5: If Gregorian Composition was 220A.<br />
    For my short form musical statement, I first built a repeating
    i-VI-III-(minor)v-i chord progression using the square oscillator played
    through an ADSR envelope and a reverb. I chose this combination because it
    gave the most “musical” timbre in my opinion as opposed to a different UGen
    such as a sine oscillator, or my homemade sample. I chose this specific
    chord progression for its somber emotion which paired perfectly with the
    Paulstretch voicemail recording which plays as a soundscape in the
    background. Finally, I used my homemade sample to fill up space on top of
    the chords and voicemail. The sample is played at one pitch, but with a
    varying gain. This pitch gave the most consonance as compared to the chords.
    I sporked the functions to play the voicemail and the homemade sample filler
    so that they would run concurrently with the chord progression. Furthermore,
    the sample is played through a sweeping LPF to give a more instrumental and
    mellow feel to the rather harsh output of an Impulse UGen. 1 minute of audio
    was recorded and uploaded for the homework. <br />
