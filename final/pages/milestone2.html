  My Final Project: Using <strong>frame differentiation</strong> on
  <strong>video input in Processing</strong> and piping the measure of
  difference to <strong>ChucK over OSC</strong> to generate
  <strong>audio with corresponding density</strong>

  As of now, I am determining the best algorithm to process video using frame
  differentiation. Below I have included screenshots of the two algorithms I am
  toying with. In one, red contours are used to visualize the motion that the
  program interprets against a background. This is known as
  <strong>background subtraction</strong>. This is built upon the OpenCV library
  for Processing using image subtraction and filtering (blur, gray-scale) to
  mitigate noise.
</p>
<p>
  The second algorithm uses pure <strong>frame differentiation</strong> using a
  mask of the prev movie frame over the current frame and displaying the result
  in gray-scale.
</p>
<p>
  In both instances, the program outputs an integer
  <em>frame difference variable</em> as the scale of variability between frames.
  It is from this value that I am going to build a
  <em>level of motion density</em> variable which will be sent to ChucK over
  OSC.

<h3 id="chuck-side-">ChucK side:</h3>
<p>
  ChucK receives an OSC message containing an integer which corresponds to the
  gain of the output sound.<br /><strong>TODO:</strong><br />ChucK needs to
  sweep cleanly between <em>density</em> values which come with each OSC
  message.<br />ChucK needs to output more, better sound.<br /><a
