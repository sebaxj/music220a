        My Final Project: Using <strong>frame differentiation</strong> on
        <strong>video input in Processing</strong> and piping the measure of
        difference to <strong>ChucK over OSC</strong> to generate
        <strong>audio with corresponding density</strong>

      <h3>Processing side:</h3>
      <p>
        As of now, I am determining the best algorithm to process video using
        frame differentiation. Below I have included screenshots of the two
        algorithms I am toying with. In one, red contours are used to visualize
        the motion that the program interprets against a background. This is
        known as <strong>background subtraction</strong>. This is built upon the
        OpenCV library for Processing using image subtraction and filtering
        (blur, gray-scale) to mitigate noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second algorithm uses pure
        <strong>frame differentiation</strong> using a mask of the prev movie
        frame over the current frame and displaying the result in gray-scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        In both instances, the program outputs an integer
        <em>frame difference variable</em> as the scale of variability between
        frames. It is from this value that I am going to build a
        <em>level of motion density</em> variable which will be sent to ChucK
        over OSC.

      <h3>ChucK side:</h3>
      <p>
        ChucK receives an OSC message containing an integer which corresponds to
        the gain of the output sound.<br />
        <strong>TODO:</strong><br />
        ChucK needs to sweep cleanly between <em>density</em> values which come
        with each OSC message.<br />
        ChucK needs to output more, better sound.<br />
