# Final Project - Sebastian James | Music 220A | Spring 2021  

 ## Milestone 1:  
 ### Three Proposals for my Final Project:  
 1. Creating an interactive audiovisual experience using the *oscP5* library in **Processing** and using *osc* messaging in **ChucK**.  
    * First, I will take in visuals from a camera in **Processing** (most likely reusing code), then using the *OSC network protocol* to communicate with **ChucK**.
    * The deliverable product would be a type of audiovisual art display with a responsive visual generated by **Processing** paired with responsive audio from **ChucK**.  
    * [oscP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/)
    * [Processing and ChucK](https://processing.org/discourse/beta/num_1203578116.html)
    * [Capture/Video Library](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/Capture.html)
    * [Example code](https://processing.org/tutorials/video/)
    * Potential Issue: It appears that **OSX Catalina** has dropped support for 32-bit compiled software. The *Video* library is 32-bit compiled so I receive the error:  
    ```
    Could not run the sketch (Target VM failed to initialize)  
    ```  
    * Potential workaround: dual-boot from Linux to develop final project in order to compile 32-bit libraries.
    * codebase:  
        * [ChucK OSC send](./lib/OSC_send.ck)
        * [ChucK OSC receive](./lib/OSC_recv.ck)
        * [Processing Webcam Input](./webcam_input/webcam_input.pde)
2. Software to package ChucK code/wav file as NFT.
3. ChucK code to interpret entropy (random sound from the environment imported by **adc**) and playback through **dac** as organized polyphony.
