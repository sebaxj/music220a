    Music 220a Homework 3, Spring 2021 <br />
    Sebastian James <br />
    Milestone Assignment:<br />
    <br />
    Part 1: <br />
    <br />
    Here, I employed some of the techniques used by J.S. Bach and Kruetzer to
    build compound melody lines using rhythmic repetition, and melodic
    repetition transposed up or down each iteration. In my examples, I use one
    bass note, increasing, followed by a short scalar repetition of high notes.
    To build on each example I used gain and timbre to further accentuate the
    bass versus treble lines. <br />

    Part 2: <br />
    <br />
    In this part of the assignment, I used Shepard Tones, refactored into
    classes, to build an auditory illusion of infinitely increasing or
    decreasing tones. Using the 'INC' variable, I am able to control whether the
    tone is increasing (positive float), decreasing (negative float), fast
    interval changes (higher absolute float), or slower interval changes (slower
    absolute float). <br />
    <br />
    In 2d and the statement, I wrote code to take in keyboard events to control
    the direction of the Shepard Tones, and whether they are playing or paused.
    The space bar key toggles sound on or off, and the 'w' key controls the
    Shepard Tone direction. <br />

    Part 3: <br />
    <br />
    When brainstorming creativity for this part, I analyzed a few of my favorite
    drops. The first is "Nique la BAC", by Lorenzo. This is a french rap song
    which approaches the drop first with silence alternating with police sirens,
    and then a frequency based drop with a sudden surge of bass/kick drum. The
    second song I analyzed is Without You (ft. Sandro Cavazza), by Avicii. Here,
    the drop builds over many measures, with only high frequencies present. When
    the song "drops", a heavy bass drum is introduced and the vocals cut out. As
    you will see, I reflect on this method and employ it heavily in my Part 3
    and 4 using a kick drum sample and a LPF sweep. <br />

    <br />
    Part 4 Statement, She-vicii, Sebastian James: <br />
    <br />
    My statement was inspired by all the previous code for this assignment.
    Firstly, I have a kick drum sample which is played throughout the piece with
    a SndBuf. With the kick drum I added a basic Am chord synth which plays with
    the kick drum. On top of that I played two instances of Shepard Tones in a
    minor third interval. In the first Shepard Tone section I used a LPF to
    sweep the resonant filter frequency of both instances. This created an
    interesting dichotomy where instead of the TriOsc waves being synched, there
    was space between them which grew and shrunk, creating a pulsating
    soundscape. When the kick drum increased in rhythm and approached "dropped",
    the Shepard Tones cut out and a bass guitar was introduced with a riff I
    programmed in. After a few iterations of this, the bass guitar, kick drum,
    and synth playing solo, the Shepard Tones in a minor third interval are
    faded back in. This time, however, a reverb filter is swept over the minor
    third tone (Shepard b3), increasing to create a heavier and larger space
    until everything cuts out on the last drop and the bass guitar plays the
    riff to finale. <br />
